**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

**SMB Utils** is a unified platform of purpose-built tools that help small and medium businesses navigate operational complexity. Each tool solves one specific problem exceptionally well — cash runway tracking, tax nexus monitoring, vendor compliance, supplier diversity documentation — without the bloat of enterprise software or the fragility of spreadsheets.

The platform targets the "spreadsheet gap" — businesses too large for manual processes but too small for enterprise solutions. By bundling focused utilities under a single subscription, SMB Utils delivers immediate value while building long-term customer relationships across multiple touchpoints.

**Core thesis:** Regulatory and operational complexity designed for enterprises is cascading down to SMBs. These businesses need surgical tools, not Swiss Army knives.

## Vision & Mission

### Vision
Become the essential operating system for small business back-office operations — the place owners check every Monday morning to know their business is healthy and compliant.

### Mission
Give every small business owner the operational visibility and compliance confidence that Fortune 500 companies take for granted, at a price point that makes sense for Main Street.

### Guiding Principles

1. **One tool, one job** — Each utility does exactly one thing. No feature creep. No "also does X."

2. **Five-minute time-to-value** — If a user can't see value within their first session, we've failed.

3. **Answers, not dashboards** — We don't show data; we answer questions. "Am I okay?" not "Here's a chart."

4. **Proactive, not reactive** — Alerts before problems, not reports after disasters.

5. **Honest pricing** — No hidden fees, no surprise overages, no enterprise sales calls required.

## Market Opportunity

### The Spreadsheet Gap

There are **33.2 million small businesses** in the United States alone. The vast majority operate in what we call the "spreadsheet gap":

### Market Sizing

| Segment | US Businesses | Target % | Addressable |
|---------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| $300K - $1M revenue | 4.2M | 15% | 630,000 |
| $1M - $5M revenue | 1.8M | 25% | 450,000 |
| $5M - $10M revenue | 400K | 30% | 120,000 |
| **Total TAM** | | | **1.2M businesses** |

At an average of $100/month platform spend:
- **SAM (Serviceable):** $1.44B annually
- **Initial target (Year 3):** 5,000 paying customers = $6M ARR

### Why Now?

1. **Regulatory cascade** — Post-Wayfair sales tax complexity, ESG disclosure requirements, supplier diversity mandates are hitting SMBs for the first time.

2. **Tool fatigue** — SMB owners are drowning in disconnected point solutions. Average small business uses 40+ SaaS tools.

3. **Spreadsheet breaking points** — COVID forced digital transformation; businesses now see spreadsheet limitations clearly.

4. **API ecosystem maturity** — QuickBooks, Xero, Stripe, Plaid APIs make integration viable for small teams.

5. **AI hype backlash** — Buyers increasingly skeptical of "AI-powered" everything; appetite for tools that just work.

## Target Customer

### Primary Persona: Owner-Operator

**Demographics:**
- Business revenue: $500K - $5M annually
- Employees: 2-25
- Industries: Professional services, trades, retail, restaurants, healthcare practices
- Role: Owner who also handles operations, or operations manager reporting to owner
- Technical comfort: Uses QuickBooks/Xero, comfortable with web apps, not a power user

- Values time over features — "just tell me what I need to know"
- Risk-averse — compliance anxiety is real
- Price-conscious but will pay for peace of mind
- Skeptical of enterprise sales pitches
- Prefers self-service; calls support only when stuck

**Pain Points:**
- "I don't know what I don't know" about compliance
- Spreadsheets are becoming unmanageable
- Can't afford a full-time operations/finance person
- Constantly worried about cash flow surprises
- Feels like they're always one audit away from disaster

**Quote:** *"I just want to run my business. I didn't sign up to become a tax expert and compliance officer."*

### Secondary Persona: Fractional CFO / Bookkeeper

**Demographics:**
- Manages finances for 3-15 small business clients
- Often solo or small firm
- Uses accounting software daily
- Needs multi-client visibility

**Need:** Tools that let them monitor multiple clients efficiently and look like heroes when they catch problems early.

**Value prop:** "Know which client needs attention before they call you."
